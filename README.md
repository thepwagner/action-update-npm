# https://github.com/thepwagner/action-update but TypeScript

This is an abandoned port of the action-update framework to TypeScript.

I started it as Actions support for JavaScript/TypeScript is much better than Go.
I abandoned it as my tolerance is much better for Go than JavaScript/TypeScript, and this is all lulz-based development.
